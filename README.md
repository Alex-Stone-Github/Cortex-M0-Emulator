# Cortex-M0-Emulator

Implementation of the armv6m architecture for cortex m0.

# How to use

This project is not in a working stage yet. Not all instructions work properly
yet, but if you wish to play around the current source file is
`./asmsrc/main.s`. If you still wish to run the development version, use the
following shell commands sequentially:

```sh
make
cargo r
```

# TODO

- Memory address implementation
- Interrupts
- Test all instructions
